# Experimental Assets Archiver
A simple archiver written in C that was used to package assets in a separate game project. This is just a foundation from which a better archiver was built.
## How to Use
This is a very simple and fun little program. You can compile it using GCC and run the resulting executable to generate a binary file that packages assets like sound, etc for games. Obviously, code has to be written in the main application to unarchive the data and load it into memory. This uses simple bitwise XOR logic to obscure the data. This is just an example of how an encryption algorithm could be applied to the data such that end users won't have access to the assets. Again, this program isn't to be used for serious serialization! This program runs in the console. Once run, the program will ask to type a character and press enter. My favorite option is the t command. It looks for a file named archiveReference.txt. If it exists, it will go through the entries, line by line, and adds it to the archived file, one after the other. A sample archiveReference file is provided. I hope you enjoy this little creation.
